# HTTPS

HTTPS has proven secure and reliable in secure data transfer between browsers and websites.  
HTTPS is a secure version of HTTP that encrypts data using either SSL(Secure Sockets Layer) or TLS(Transport Layer Security).  
In this project, I will be exploring HTTPS with SSL as the secure protocol.  
The project covers the following objectives:
* What is HTTPS SSL and the 2 main roles
* What is the purpose of encrypting traffic
* What SSL termination means
